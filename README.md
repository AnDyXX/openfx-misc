===========

AnDyX OpenFX plugins:
--------

SpheriseAX - allows to create effect similar to Liquify plugin in Photoshop. Effect can be seen here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ruw8gKPjc

Will try to make it work on other hosts. Currently I have Sony Vegas trial. Hope I will be able to make plugins to work before trial expires.

Original README content

[Natron](http://natron.inria.fr), but may be used with other
[OpenFX](http://openeffects.org) hosts.

More information about OpenFX Hosts, OpenFX Plugins (commercial or
free), and OpenFX documentation can be found at
<http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/openfx/>.

Notes & Caveats
---------------

### Transform and CornerPin produce aliasing when scaling down images

The transform nodes may produce aliasing artifacts when downscaling by a factor of 2 or more.

This can be avoided by blurring (using BlurCImg) or resizing (using ResizeOIIO) the image before downscaling it.

There are several solutions to this problem, which may be implemented in the future (you can help!):

* Trilinear mipmapping (as implemented by OpenGL) still produces artifacts when scaling is anisotropic (i.e. the scaling factor is different along two directions)
* [Feline (McCormack, 1999)](http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/Compaq-DEC/WRL-99-1.pdf), which is close to what is proposed in [OpenGL's anisotropic texture filter](http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/texture_filter_anisotropic.txt) is probably 4-5 times slower than mipmapping, but produces less artifacts
* [EWA (Heckbert 1989)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ph/texfund/texfund.pdf) would give the highest quality, but is probably 20 times slower than mipmapping.

A sample implementation of the three methods is given in [Mesa 3D](http://mesa3d.org/)'s [software rasterizer, src/mesa/swrast/s_texfilter.c](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/tree/src/mesa/swrast/s_texfilter.c).

### What does the Roto plugin do?

If you use the Roto plugin in any other host than [Natron](http://natron.inria.fr), you will notice that it doesn't do much. Its role is just to provide an entry point for a host-based rotoscoping tool, which provides a roto mask to this plugin.

### ColorLookup does not work on Nuke 8/9, DaVinci Resolve...

Although Nuke 8 & 9 claim via OpenFX that they support parametric parameters (i.e. adjustable parametric curves), these don't work (at least on OS X, and maybe on other platforms). The plugins cannot be instanciated, nothing seems to happen, and the following message appears on the console:

    Exception thrown
      basic_string::_S_construct NULL not valid

The same happens with other plugins using parametric parameters, such as [TuttleHistogramKeyer](http://www.tuttleofx.org/).

Parametric parameters work in older versions of Nuke (at least in Nuke 6 & 7).

DaVinci Resolve does not support parametric parameters.

Please [file an issue](https://github.com/devernay/openfx-misc/issues) if you think openfx-misc is doing something wrong, or you know of other hosts which have problems with parametric paremeters.

Although ColorCorrect uses parametric parameters, it can still be instanciated on Nuke 8 & 9 and on DaVinci Resolve, but the curve ranges are not adjustable (shadows are decreasing linearly from 0 to 0.09, and highlights are increasing linearly from 0.5 to 1.0).

Installation
------------

These plugins are included in the binary distributions of [Natron](http://natron.inria.fr).

If you want to compile the plugins from source, you may either use the
provided Unix Makefile, the Xcode project, or the Visual Studio project.

### Getting the sources from github

To fetch the latest sources from github, execute the following commands:

	git clone https://github.com/devernay/openfx-misc.git
	cd openfx-misc
	git submodule update -i -r

In order to get a specific tag, corresponding to a source release, do `git tag -l`
to get the list of tags, and then `git checkout tags/<tag_name>`
to checkout a given tag.

### Unix/Linux/FreeBSD/OS X, using Makefiles

To compile an optimized version for a 64-bits machine: open a shell in
the toplevel directory, and type

	make DEBUGFLAG=-O3 BITS=64

Without the DEBUGFLAG flag, a debug version will be compiled, and use
BITS=32 to compile a 32-bits version.

The compiled plugins will be placed in subdiecories named after the
configuration, for example Linux-64-realease for a 64-bits Linux
compilation. In each of these directories, you will find a `*.bundle`
file, which has to be moved to the proper place (`/usr/OFX/Plugins`on
Linus, or `/Library/OFX/Plugins`on OS X), using a command like:
	sudo mv */*/*.bundle /usr/OFX/Plugins

### OS X, using Xcode

The plugins may be compiled by compiling the Xcode project called
`Misc.xcodeproj` in the toplevel directory. The bundles produced by
this project have to be moved to `/Library/OFX/Plugins`.

Alternatively, you can compile from the command-line using:

	xcodebuild -project Misc.xcodeproj -configuration Release install
	sudo mkdir /Library/OFX/Plugins
	sudo mv /tmp/Misc.dst/Library/OFX/Plugins/Misc /Library/OFX/Plugins

### MS Windows, using Visual Studio

Compile using the provided `Misc.vcxproj`project found in the `Misc`
directory.

32-bits plugins should be installed in the directory `c:\Program Files
(x86)\Common Files\OFX\Plugin`, 64-bits plugins should be installed in
`c:\Program Files\Common Files\OFX\Plugins`.
